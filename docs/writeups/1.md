# Building a version manager for Zig (Part 1)

Welcome to the first part of a series of posts where you will accompany me in the development of a version manager for Zig.

## Getting our hands dirty

Just like pretty much every CLI tool, we need to parse the command-line arguments. Although a few Zig libraries exist to help with this task, I decided to write my own. This will allow us to get a control and understanding of the parsing process.

After a few minutes of thinking, I came up with the following API:

#### Command

```zig
pub const Command = struct {
    name: []const u8,
    description: []const u8,
    handler: fn (args: []const []const u8) void,
};
```
